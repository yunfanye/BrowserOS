BrowserOS puts AI chat at your fingertips. Open a chat panel on any webpage to ask questions with full page context, or compare responses across multiple LLMs side-by-side.

## LLM Chat

Click the **Chat** button in the toolbar (or press `Option+K`) to open an AI chat panel on any webpage.

The Hub lets you query multiple LLMs simultaneously:

1. Choose 1, 2, or 3 panes using the panel selector in the top-right
2. Select which LLM to use in each pane (Claude, Gemini, or ChatGPT)
3. Paste your prompt into each pane and compare responses

This is useful when you want an "LLM council" — get multiple perspectives on a question and see where the models agree or differ.

Control which buttons appear in your toolbar from **Settings → Customization**:

- **Show Chat Button** — Display the Chat button in the toolbar
- **Show Hub Button** — Display the Hub button in the toolbar
